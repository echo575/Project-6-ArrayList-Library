# Project-6-ArrayList-Library

Some things to note:
1. I can't really "display" the books other than showing a list of their titles -- so for options to display books sorted in a specific order, I just outputted a book titles 
2. I still included the Driver file even though it probably doesn't even matter to this project because it was part of the files to be downloaded as noted on Canvas
3. I originally did this entire project in Repl.it, so the screenshots of the program execution show the program running in Repl.it
4. The first set of screenshots show the program running once, and the second set of screenshots show the program running again (more detailed) -- all options are tested for both
5. I didn't really know how to transfer the files over from Repl.it to Github, so I downloaded the files onto my local computer and just uploaded the files to Github from there
